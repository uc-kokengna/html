		<h2>Graphics Card (Graphics Processing Unit or GPU)</h2> 
			<p>Renders 3D images, animations and video for computer screen.
			A powerful GPU produces higher resolution, faster and smoother visuals in games, video-editing and movies. 
			There are two seperate categories of GPUs; integrated and dedicated (discrete).
			Integrated cards are graphics cards built into the CPU. 
			Offering underpowered rendering suited more for simple and dedicated to web browsing, streaming videos, minimal photo editing and light gaming. 
			Dedicated, or discrete, graphics are designed for demanding workloads such as high detailed games, crypto mining, photo and video editing.
			All discrete graphics cards connect via PCIE x16 on motherboard producing optimal performance, but can be installed on lower bandwith PCIEs (e.g. PCIE x4). 
			Above is an example of a high-performance graphics cards. Here are its specifications: NVIDIA GTX 970 SC ACX 2.0 Base Clock: 1165 MHz / Boost Clock: 1317 MHz
Memory Clock: 7010 MHz Effective; Memory Detail: 4096MB GDDR.

			<dt><strong>Nvidia and AMD</strong></dt>
					<dd>These two companies are the top designers of graphics cards.
					AMD creates Radeon RX series. Whereas, Nvidia produces the GTX and RTX series. 
					Both companies create a chipset, a chip on graphics card that performs calculations to render and display images,
						as well as the physical design and specifications of the GPU.
					Afterwards, the design is sent to partnered gpu manufacturers, e.g. Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte and MSI. 
					Manufacturers can then modify the GPU, its cooling efficiency, core clock, length and boost clock.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Core Clock:</strong></dt>
					<dd>The actual speed which the graphics processor on a video card operates.
					Higher core clock speeds means better performance.
					Core clock speed can be changed via third-party applications to gain a performance boost, called overclocking, which will require better system cooling
						and a more powerful computer battery(PSU).
					Core clock is measured in megahertz (MHz), e.g. Core Clock 1708 MHz.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Boost Clock</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Dynamic speed adjustment increasing clock speeds until the graphics card hits its predetermined Power Target.
					Real-time changes will be applied to the core speed depending on the graphic cards current running voltage and temperature. 
					This is mainly applied when running high performance applications and can easily be overclocked.
					Boost clock is measured in megahertz (MHz), e.g. Boost Clock 1847 MHz.
					</dd>
					<dt><strong>Video RAM:</strong></dt>
					<dd>"Video Random Access Memory" (VRAM or Frame Buffer). Memory used to store image data that the computer displays; acts as a buffer between the CPU and the video card.
					Modern graphics cards use graphics double data rate type five(GDDR5); I shortened the actual definition.
					The more vRAM a card has, the more complex textures or 3D meshes it can load.
					The higher the resolution of the image you’re rendering, the more VRAM is required. 
					If the texture and images overload your GPU’s VRAM, the overflow dumps into system RAM, negatively impacting performance.
					Bottom line, more VRAM means higher quality resolution with less performance impact.
					VRAM is labled as "Memory clock" when overclocking.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Thermal and Power:</strong></dt> 
					<dd>All graphic cards are designed for a specified max temperature, measured in celcius, and system power, wattage.
					It's reccomended to buy a system case that supports great air cooling and at least a moderately powerful battery.
					Make sure your system power supply meets the reccomendations (wattage, volts, and amps) before purchasing your graphics card. </dd>
					<dt><strong>Nvidia SLI and AMD CROSSFIRE</strong></dt>
					<dd>Two similar, but seperate, technologies allowing users to pair two or more graphics cards together in one system to achieve higher graphics performance. 
							Though, you will notice a graphical performance increase, the technology does have it's limitations and doubling the amount of graphics cards in your system won’t always to desired performance. 
								Not all games support paired GPUs, so expect some performance inconsistencies.
									The biggest challenge to achieve SLI/CROSSFIRE is the computer will need to be powerful enough to support the extra demand of having mulitple graphics cards, e.g. powerful cpu,
					extra cooling, and a strong efficient battery.
										To physically connect multiple GPUs, a seperate connector "Bridge Connector" is needed.  The Bridge Connector connects via "nub" on top of a graphics card; the more nubs a gpu has the more gpus can be linked together.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Wattage and Amps:</strong></dt> 
				<dd>Amount of wattage and amps to efficiently power a graphics card  via +12V rail (graphics card power connector).
				The minimum amount is labled on the side of the graphics cards box, manufacture and suppliers site.
				An example of the requirements, "400 watt or greater power supply with a minimum of 20 amps on the +12 volt rail".
				Essentially, wattage is the power requirement it takes to turn on the GPU and Amps is the amount it takes for the GPU to stay on.
				If your power supply is inefficient, you will need to downgrade the graphics card or purchase a new power unit.
