			<p> Typically overlooked, the power supply is one of the more importatnt parts of a computer.
			Picking a high quaility power supply will garuntee your computer to run smoothly by supplying components enough wattage.
			Cheap units will cause noticable problems and may even lead to the unit to explode, destroying the computer in the process.
			It's best to go with larger units as they effectively distribute power and last longer.
			Power supplies contain one large exhaust fan and mount to the bottom or top of computer case.
			Where to mount depends on the case, but they're normally stationed at the bottom.
			All power connectors and cords are labled with the included PSU manual.

			<dl>
			<dt><strong>Manufacturer (Original Electronic Manufacturer or OEM)</strong></dt> 
				<dd>Pay close attention to the brand of the power supply. 
				Some manufactureres are more well known than others at producing higher quality units and less
					likely chance you will recieve a dead on arrival (DOA) power supply.
				Well known manufactureres include Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic and Thermaltake.
					</dd>
					<dt><strong>Power Suppy Types:</strong></dt>
					<dd>  There are several different power supply form factors, sizes, connector types, output specifications and other important specs.
					Most common types include ATX, ATX12V, and ATX12V/EPS12V.
					ATX is outdated and replaced by its better ATX12V.
					ATX12V adds more dedicated connectors for specific components.
					ATX12V/EPS12V leans towards servers and high performance computers.
					There's other technicals, but to save headaches, ATX12V is the bare minimum and consider ATX12V/EPS12V if your system will perform
						high demand gaming or video editing.
					
					</dd>
					
					
				<dt><strong>Wattage:</strong></dt>
					<dd> How much overall power a system needs in order to function.
					Selecting the right amount of wattage is tricky as it varies by components.
					One best method is to shoot high and purchase an overpowered power supply, this will help if you plan to upgrade your system
		
					There are availible calculators online that can monitor your systems wattage, or go to 
					PCPartPicker.com, which lets you select your components and shows the wattage required for each individual part 
						or virtaully build your computer with parts and see the combined total wattage.
					</dd>
					
				<dt><strong>Modular Types:</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Originally, power supply units came with the necessary power cables permanently connected directly to the power supply, this is no longer the case.
					Now, there are modular PSUs that are "semi-modular" and "fully-modular".
					Modular PSUs provide connectors at the units end, allowing unused cables to detach from the power supply,
						producing less clutter, cleaner computer appearance and less airflow interference.
					Semi-modulars have only essential cables pre-attached which cannot be removed, e.g. 24-pin main connector (motherboard).	
					Full modulars come with no cables pre-attached, you only attach the cables you need.
						 Semi-modulars are more common and are budget friendly, while fully modulars are expensive but ideal for enthusiasts and space saving.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Efficiency:</strong></dt>
					<dd>Power supplies are rated in terms of their efficiency, with higher quality units certified at higher 80 PLUS (goes beyond 80%) rating levels. 
					Just imagine efficiency as how well the power supply will perform overall and higher certified units produce percentage better efficiency, e.g. 80 Plus Gold
					80 Plus efficiency ratings are in order from good to best: 80 Plus, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum.
					For example, a complete built computer draws 647 W from the wall socket and rated at 85% efficiency will need a 550 W-rated unit (647W x 0.85). 
					From there, if adding additional peripherals, a high quality 600W will be best.
					It's best to aim for a strong efficiency rating.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Rail power (+12V rail) :</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Largely applies to graphics cards, rail specific power is the measure of how much power certain components in a build draw from the power supply.
					Insufficient power draw from the rail will prevent the graphics card from starting or staying on long.
					While voltage is important, Amp is equally vital and often overlooked.
					Multiple rail connectors may be necessary for higher performance graphics cards and are supplied by the power supply unit and graphics card manufacturer.
					Refer to the manufacturerâ€™s specifications for how much power a particular card needs, and then check that the power supply is up to the task.
