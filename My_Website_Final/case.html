			<p>It's difficult to find the perfect case, as there are many with some sort of drawback to compensate for lacking a supportive feature.
			
			You want to choose a case that's the right size for your needs and has plenty of room for your hardware and devices.
			
			Other aspects to consider when choosing a perfect case: case fans, water-cooling, proper air-flow, GPUs, storage units, PCIs, and cable management (yes im very serious).
			If too many components are installed inside the case, excessive heat generates leading to performance decrease, but having many fans will compensate.
			Cables inside a case can affect air-flow, get caught in fans and makes installing other components a giant hassle. 
	
			Full-tower, mid-tower, and mini-ITX are the three sizes most commonly used.
			Full-tower and mid-tower cases both fit standard ATX motherboardsâ€”the most common motherboard size and both cases can support smaller form factor motherboards, e.g. micro-ATX.

			<dt><strong>Mid-Towers Bridge the Gap</strong></dt> 
				<dd>
				The most common form factor, Mid-Towers are great in bridging the gap between portability and inner case space.
				More often than not, these cases can have plenty of room for a couple of GPUs, water-cooling, storage and multiple fans. 
				Their dimensions are a bit more various, offering larger variety of choices, and can be from 16 to 20 inches in both width and height.
				When choosing a mid-tower, pay close attention to the distance between the side (inside the case) where you install a motherboard to the side directly accross; aka "depth".
				As dimension example, 16" width x 20" height x 8" depth.
				Mainly, depth is important to insure your graphics card has room for it's power connectors, air-flow and to prevent other damages.
			Some high-performance graphics cards may not fit inside a mid-tower and it's highly recommended to know both dimensions of mid-tower case and graphics card.
			If in the near future you decide to install more components, it'll be more wise to look at Full-Towers.

				<dt><strong>Full-Towers Sacrifice Portability For Space</strong></dt>
					<dd>A larger version of mid-towers, often measures more than 20 inches height by 20 inches width; depth is typically 10 inches max.
					Full-Towers are used more by pc enthusiats, high-performance gamers and video editors.
					Full-Towers hold more cooling fans making them overclock friendly and less vulnerable to high temperatures.
					Even with endless possibilities, they are more expensive, heavier and take up more space.
					Consider full-towers if planning to install multiple graphics cards, fans, storages, accessory cards or water-cooling.
					An alternative and popular practice is installing components built for Micro Mini-Towers to keep the inside case more organized and greatly promote better air-flow.
					
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Micro Mini-Towers Sacrifices Space For Portability</strong></dt>
					<dd> Smaller cases built for mini-ITX motherboards and strongly considered for wanting to save space, better transportation, LAN parties, or setting up in smaller areas, e.g. living room.
					Although, their smaller size prevents multiple installations of graphics cards, RAM, storage, fans and no option of water-cooling.
					Since their size prevents multiple installed components, mini-towers are more prone to overheating and underperform when compared to larger built computers. 
					With exception of more expensive mini-towers, most mini-ITX cases will not support full-length graphics cards and their portable models will need to be used; you can dismiss all other component sizes.
