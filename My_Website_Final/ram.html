			<p> RAM temporarily stores informational data (not a disk storage).
			Choosing RAM is simple for average users, but can be a difficult for high performance users.
			This is largly due to different compatibilities with motherboards and performance differs vastly.
			RAM sticks come as pairs of Dual In Line Memory Module (DIMM) for desktops and Small Outline DIMM (SO-DIMM) on laptops, with the same amount of gigabytes on each RAM or "stick".
			 It's recommended to pair both included or exact module RAM because it enables Dual Channel mode which dramatically improves performance.
			The number of memory sticks physically installed is determined by the amount of availible slots on the motherboard.
				Most common amount of availible slots for RAM instillation is four; server and extreme performance motherboards have more slots.
		RAM can be overclocked on a capable motherboard via BIOS.
			</p>
			<dl>
			<dt><strong>System Compatibility:</strong></dt> 
				<dd>When it comes to installing memory, there are strong sets of rules to follow.
				Motherboards are built to support specific speeds and types of memory set by the manufacter. 
				You cannot install a last generation RAM type onto a current generation motherboard that doesn't support the module; cannot install DDR3 memory into DDR4 only motherboard and vice versa.
			Maximum allowed amount of gigabytes is determined by both motherboard, CPU and operating system.
				Since many OS can support a very high amount of gigabytes, e.g. max GB allowed on Windows 10 Home x64 is 128GB, you're only limited by the motherboard and CPU.	

				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Speed: </strong></dt>
					<dd>Identified based on the speed at which they can transfer information and a primary contributor in memory performance.
					The faster the number, the faster your computer can store and retrieve the data stored in megahertz, e.g. DDR4-3200(MHz).
					Its highly recommended to have all your RAM be the same speed, but if different speeds are installed, all individual sticks scale down to match the RAM stick(s) with the lowest speed.
					For example, you install one DDR4-2400 and DDR4-2133, the 2400 will scale down to 2133, now having two DDR4-2133s.
					There really isn't any noticable (if any) performance boost for games, but you can see an increase of speed for transfering data and other applications.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Timing (Latency):</strong></dt>
					<dd>Timing deals with how fast the RAM module can access its own hardware.
					Lower latency means faster data access, faster data transfer to the CPU and faster operation of your computer.
					Timing is identified as a set of four numbers on every RAM stick, e.g. 15-17-17-35.
					
					Higher quality and expensive RAM will have lower latency.
					Latency can be altered by overclocking, but changing the latency could lead to more instabilities and system crashes.
					Again, you wont physically witness a great (if any) performance boost for games, but you will see an increase of speed for transfering data and other applications.
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>How much RAM?</strong></dt> 
					<dd>It's recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM for most modern games,.
					Although, since many programs run in the background and interfere
						with gaming performance, and some games are more demanding than others, it's more common to have 16GB.
					Web surfing and everyday users will be fine with 4GB but 8GB is more ideal.</dd>
