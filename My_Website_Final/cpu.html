		<p>Considered the "brain" of the computer and an important performance aspect.
			The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, receives data input, executes instructions, processes information and
				communicates with nearly every device within the computer.
			For size comparison, seen in the top most image, it's roughly twice the size of a quarter.

			<dt><strong>AMD and Intel:</strong></dt> 
				<dd>Intel and AMD are the largest global processor manufacturers. <br>
				Intel's more expensive. Considered the "go to" option for superior gaming performance, websurfing and overclocking.<br>
				AMD's budget friendly. Better suited for animation, video-editing and comparible gaming performance.<br>
				Though unnecessary, it's typically recommended to choose based on the primary purpose of your computer.<br>
				If you're having difficulty deciding, numerous performance graphic charts are availible online.</dd>
			
				<dt><strong>CPU Socket:</strong></dt> 
				<dd>
				A discrete mount, used only for the CPU to guarantee correct insertion on motherboard. <br>
				Located underneath are pin connectors (image two) connecting CPU to motherboard (think of plugging a power cord into a wall socket).
				All CPUs have built socket types. Solely compatible to specific motherboards with same socket.
				To clarify, you cannot install a processor having socket type "A" to a motherboard designed for socket type "B".
				
				
				<br>
				<strong>*Important: Due to high sensitivity of grease and electrostatic shock, do not touch the bottom of CPU!</strong>
				</dd>
				
				<dt><strong>Clock speed:</strong></dt>
				<dd>The speed which a microprocessor (or CPU) executes instructions. 
				The faster the clock speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), the more instructions the CPU can execute per second.
				CPUs will automatically adjust clock speed based on its temperature and task performance.
				Clock speed is generally looked at when purchasing or upgrading computers for high performance programs and multitasking.</dd>
				
				<dt><strong>Cores: </strong></dt>
					<dd> 
					Simply put, these are smaller processors within the actual processor and each core handles its own specific task given. 
					Many processors contain four to eight cores, you want to have at least 4 cores for optimal performance. 
					Anyone desiring PCs for high performce overclocking, gaming or demanding applications should invest in 16 cores or more!
					
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Integrated Graphics:</strong></dt>
					<dd>A "graphics card" embedded onto the processor. Used as an alternative for systems without a dedicated graphics card, e.g. NVIDIA GTX 1080. 
					Since they're integrated on processors, integrated graphics require less voltage and can output high monitor resolutions.  
						One huge disadvantage is that their not nearly as powerful as a dedicated graphics card. 
						  Depending on game and monitor resolution, you can play games at low to moderate settings but do not expect high gaming performance. 
						 </dd>
				<dt><strong>Overclocking:</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Pushing the CPU performance beyond its performance.  
					A common practice for enthusiasts and gamers desiring extra performance.
					Newcomers will this tedious and intimidating, but it's well worth the results. 
					First off, not all processors are overclockable. Intel has a “K” or "X" suffix at the end of model number, meaning its "unlocked" and ready to be overclocked.
					All current Ryzen CPUs are unlocked, their “X” suffix signifies it’ll achieve higher clock speeds.
					One way to successfully overclock is to adjust the clock speed in small amounts; e.g. increase 4.0GHz to 4.1GHz.
					View results by running a software performance test, tempurature monitoring software and repeat. 
					Increase CPU Voltage, if you're not obtaining better results after overclocking (This is more or less learning from trial and error)
					An easier option is to view online overclocking guides using the exact processor. 
					
					Remember, overclocking methods and results vary based on CPU, motherboard and other installed components.
