			<p>When upgrading or building, determining storage is a simple task.
			Two main storage devices to consider are the Hard Disk Drive and Solid State Disk, 
			a third powerful alternative would be an M.2 SSD. 
			Drives are connected via SATA cord connecting to motherboard and a power connector from the power supply.
			SATA cords are provided with every computer battery purchased.
			Power connectors are normally purchased separately.

			<dl>
			<dt><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD or Hard Disk):</strong></dt> 
				<dd>A mechanical storage device connected to the motherboard via SATA (Serial AT Attachment) connector.
				Due to their use of mechanical parts, they're more prone to overheating, failing and shorter life expectancy.
				HDDs contain more storage for files, documents, pictures and are more inexpensive.
				Their max rate of transfering data is limited to 6Gb/s (6 Giga bits per second), but because HDDs cannot achieve the max rate, they are significantly slower.
				
				Instead of having only a single HDD, a better alternative is to install both an SSD/HDD; install your OS onto the SSD and keep all remaining files on HDD.
				HDDs are more seen as a cheap solution for storing large amounts of data.
				</dd>
				<dt><strong>Solid State Disk (SSD):</strong></dt>
					<dd>An electrical based storage device connected to the motherboard via SATA (Serial AT Attachment) connector.
					Ideal for installing your operating system for shorter boot times, quicker application launch, and faster file reading/writing speeds.
					Due to higher higher reading/writing speeds, they are closer to achieving their 6Gb/s limit, producing much higher speed transfers.
				 SSDs are more expensive than HDDs, but recently became more affordable.
					<br><strong>To avoid damage, never perform a Disk Defragmentation on any SSD.</strong>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>M.2 SSD (M.2):</strong></dt>
					<dd>Use type "M" interface; PCIe x4/SATA.
					Internal mounted computer expansion card designed to enable high-performance storage.
					About 22mm, the size is more similar to a stick of RAM than an SSD or HDD.
					M.2 connectors support four lanes of PCIe bandwidth (PCIe x4), SATA, or USB lane.
					For best results, it's ideal to connect via PCIe x4 (31.5Gb/s) or the designated 
						area according to your motherboard manufacturer.
					M.2s are very expensive and some motherboard manufacturers share the PCI-Express lanes with SATA ports 
						(installing one M.2 may void devices connected to SATA ports).
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Read and Write Speeds:</strong></dt> 
					<dd>The rate of reading/writing files to/from a storage unit. 
					Sequential is the speed at reading/writing large files, e.g. movies, games and "4k" is the speed at reading/writing small files (4 kB in size).	
					Just like with most components, the higher the speed the more powerful the device.
					When upgrading or purchasing for storage, Sequential and 4k reading/writing are the speeds to consider.
					Honestly, any SSD or M.2 device will produce high performance results over a typical HDD.
