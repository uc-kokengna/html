	<p>Second to CPU, the motherboard is the most difficult and important component of any computer. Motherboards, or MB, will determine CPU type, memory, and computer case. 
	This page will provide brief explanations and highlight important motherboard areas.
	<p>
	 <b>Motherboard image (Figure 1) has been modified to include numbers labeling motherboard areas.</b>

			<dl>
			<dt><strong>Battle of the Brands:</strong></dt> 
				<dd> Intel and AMD are <em>the</em> largest manufactured branded motherboards. 
				Both Intel and AMD motherboards can only use their own branded CPUs.
				This means you can't install Intel CPUs on AMD MBs and vice versa.</dd>
				
				
				
				<dt><strong>Motherboard Size (Form Factor):</strong></dt>
					<dd>Most common sizes include Micro ATX (small), ATX (Medium). 
					ATX stike a balance having enough expandible slots for upgradability. 
					Micro ATX has become more adopted, due to cost effectiveness and smaller size.
					Smaller boards limit options for add in installations but offer benefits for space saving and tighter budgets.
					Larger boards are more expensive but offer more options on installed components, e.g. RAM, wireless cards, and sound cards.</dd>
					
				<dt><strong>(1) CPU Socket:</strong></dt>
					<dd> 
					Motherboards have built-in socket types compatible with specified CPUs sharing the same socket.
					As of now, AMD has confrimed very few select motherboards to be backwards compatible with older sockets.
					A motherboard with a socket, e.g. LGA1150, means you can only apply CPUs with the same LGA1150 socket.  
					Intel and AMD specify a socket to each generation of their CPU or CPU family, e.g. Intel CPU Corei5-4690K carries type LGA1150 socket.
					To tell the difference between Intel and AMD sockets; Intel carries the letters LGA. and AMD as AM.
					<br> <strong>Its highly recommended to know your desired CPU before purchasing the motherboard.</strong>
					</dd>
					
				<dt><strong>(2) Memory Slots (RAM):</strong></dt> 
					<dd>"Random Access Memory" slots. Newer motherboard models support DDR4 (Double Data Rate fourth generation) RAM. Recent older models support DDR3.
					Most motherboards have 4 slots for memory, but depending on size of motherboard they can have fewer or more. 
					Motherboards are built to support specific speeds of memory, e.g. DDR4-2133 (more in Memory page). 
					The Maximum amount of RAM supported is 64GB but can vary based on motherboard size and Operating System.</dd>
				
				<dt><strong> (3) Expansion Slot (PCIE):</strong></dt>
					<dd>"Peripheral Component Interconnect Express". A designated slot for graphics cards. <br>
					Two or more PCIE slots permit multiple graphics card installation for superb graphic performance.
					The PCIE closest to CPU socket is called the PCIE x16; x16 means higher bandwidth communication between device and motherboard.
					Depending on motherboard, the second PCIE can be x8 (new) or x4 (older).</dd>
			
			<dt><strong> (4) Rear Panel I/O (ports):</strong></dt> 
					<dd>
					Connects peripherals such as monitor, speakers, keyboard, and mouse. 
					Every motherboard carries Inputs/Outputs such as HDMI, DVI, USB, USB-C, LAN port, and audio jacks.
					<br>Video ports on a motherboard can be used if the graphic card fails or not installed.
					The quantity of ports vary based on motherboard. </dd>
				
				<dt><strong>(5) Storage:</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Ports connecting storage devices SSD or HDD. Each device requires one free connection port.
					SATAs (Serial AT Attachment) ports are capable of up to 6 giga bits per second (6GB/S) of transfer rate; speed of data flow to and from storage device.
					An alternative are the M.2 SSDs (more on Storage page). Which are capable of 10GB/S, but are more costly.
			<b>Intel's Optane Memory is not compatible with SATA ports. Requiring an open PCI or M.2, depending on model.</b>
					
					</dd>
			
				<dt><strong>(6) Additional Expansion Slots (PCI):</strong></dt> 
					<dd>Peripheral Component Interconnect. Used installing Intels Optane Memory, built-in Wi-Fi and sound cards.
					Otherwise, PCI's no longer serve much modern day purposes. </dd>
				
				<dt><strong>Overclocking: </strong></dt> 
					<dd>Overclocking, "the configuration of computer hardware components to operate faster than certified by the original manufacturer..." [Wikipedia].
					Listed below are instructions to distinquish overclockable CPUs and ocverclock compatible Motherboards.
					<ul>
						<li>Intel motherboards: "X" or "Z" designation on the model, e.g. "<b>Z</b>370".</li>
						<li>AMD motherboards: "X" or "B", e.g. Gigabyte <b>X</b>470 AORUS ULTRA GAMING. Despite indicator, some may not be OC compatible. </li>
						<li>Intel CPU: "K" designation on end of model numbers, e.g. Intel Core i7-8700<b>K</b>.</li>
						<li>AMD CPU: Current AMD CPUs (Ryzen) are all overclockable, "X" designation allows higher overclocking, e.g. AMD Ryzen 7 2700<b>X</b>.</li>
					</ul>
